SASS Responsive Web Design

For this assignment, you'll be creating the wireframe below and turning into a site that not only renders well from a normal desktop size, but also transitions and is very usable on smaller viewports.

After completing this project, I developed a solid understanding of HTML/CSS/SASS; I understand principles of RWD (Responsive Web Design) now have the ability to  effectively execute a solid flow of content from desktop to mobile while leveraging developer tools to test on mobile devices.

Technologies: HTML/CSS/SASS; Responsive Web Design
